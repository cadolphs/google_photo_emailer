# My attempt at a Google Photo emailer
Because there's no easy automation for emailing Google Photo pictures to someone, I'll try and make my own.

In my previous attempt (see earlier commits) I tried too many new things at once:
- Developing in a cloud dev environment (GitPod)
- Developing in Rust
- Working with OAuth2
- Working with REST APIs
- Trying James Shore's "testing without mocks" techniques.

That made for slow development for a product I can't spend that much time on. So now, let's do it a bit easier:
- Develop locally
- Develop in Python. I know Python inside out **and** it has lots of well-developed packages. (Rust is still awesome!)
- Skip the OAuth2 and Google Photo rest stuff for now and JUST email photos from a folder!
- Still try and use James Shore's "testing without mocks" techniques

# First milestone
The splitting of a project into milestones shouldn't just be based on the characteristics of the project itself; it should also take into account 
the skills and knowledge of the developers. So, for me right now, a first milestone would just be to write a python script that sends an email on my behalf. 

## Steps taken:
- Set up virtual environment with Python 3.11.
- Google "How to send emails on Google's behalf" or whatever. Get some advice using their REST API, getting client secrets and packages to install.
