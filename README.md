# google_photo_emailer
I need a tool to automatically forward photos added to a particular Google Photo Album to a particular email address. I'll develop it in this repo and hope that parts of it might be useful for others. 

From what I gather, popular automation tools like IFTTT or Zapier don't have Google Photos integrations, so I'll need to do something custom.

This will take some time as it's not urgent and I'm learning about a number of web things as I go (e.g. authenticating with Google via oauth2 in an application).
